# KNIME Attribute Scaling Demo

This project demonstrates attribute scaling and normalization using **KNIME Analytics Platform**.

Based on a sample dataset (`column_names.csv`), we applied different preprocessing techniques and visualized the effects using scatter plots.

## 📁 Contents

- `column_names.csv`: Sample input dataset used in the KNIME workflow.
- `1.svg`: Scatter plot **before scaling** (raw data).
- `2.svg`: Scatter plot **after scaling/normalization** (processed data).
- `erg_2.docx`: Brief documentation and explanation of the workflow steps and interpretation of results.

## 🛠️ Workflow Summary

The KNIME workflow includes the following steps:

1. Import the dataset (`column_names.csv`)
2. Apply attribute scaling (standardization / min-max normalization)
3. Visualize features before and after preprocessing
4. Export scatter plots as SVG files

## 🖼️ Visual Output

- `1.svg` shows the data before scaling  
- `2.svg` shows the data after applying scaling techniques

## 🔍 Purpose

This demo highlights the **importance of feature scaling** in data preprocessing, especially prior to machine learning applications.
